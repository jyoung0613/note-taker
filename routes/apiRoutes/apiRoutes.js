// need Get /api/notes should read db.json file and return saved notes as JSON

// need post /api/notes should receive new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file and then return a new note to the client
// you'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when its saved(look into npm packages that could do this for us)
